# Handwritten Digit Classification using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Handwritten Digit Classification model** using **Deep Learning**. The model is built to recognize and predict handwritten digits (0-9) using a **Neural Network** architecture. This project provides a solid understanding of the application of machine learning techniques in the field of **Computer Vision** and is based on the famous **MNIST dataset**.

## Project Workflow

1. **Dataset Preparation**  
   The project utilizes the **MNIST dataset**, which contains 70,000 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits, divided into a training set of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images.

2. **Image Processing**  
   The images are normalized and reshaped to make them suitable for feeding into the neural network model.

3. **Train/Test Split**  
   The dataset is split into training and testing subsets to evaluate the model's performance after training.

4. **Neural Network Training**  
   A multi-layer neural network is trained using backpropagation and gradient descent techniques to minimize prediction error. The model's architecture is fine-tuned to improve accuracy.

5. **Final Prediction**  
   The trained model is then used to predict the handwritten digits from the test set. The performance of the model is evaluated based on accuracy and loss metrics.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for model development.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning libraries used to build and train the neural network.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and dataset manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization and plotting.

## Results
The model achieves a high accuracy on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning for handwritten digit recognition. The predictions are visually compared to the actual labels to evaluate model performance.
